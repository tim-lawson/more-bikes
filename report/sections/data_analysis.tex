\section{Data analysis}

For sub-tasks 1 and 2, the data comprises a set of 75 time series of the number
of available bikes at each rental station, with a fixed hourly interval.

Exploratory data analysis yielded the following observations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The precipitation feature is zero for all data points, i.e., it is missing.
\end{itemize}

For sub-task 1, the features that are properties of the rental station are
constant and thus not useful for prediction.

The pairwise correlations between the features were computed over all 75
time series, with the following observations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The `short' and `full' average numbers of bikes and differences in the
        average numbers of bikes are fully correlated, i.e., either the `short'
        or `full' versions of these features are redundant.
  \item The average and maximum wind speed are strongly positively correlated,
        i.e., one of these two features is redundant.
\end{itemize}
