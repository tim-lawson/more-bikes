\section{Introduction}

The task is to predict the number of available bikes at each of 75 rental
stations over a period of three months.
It is divided into four sub-tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Predict with a separate model for each rental station.
  \item Predict with a single model for all rental stations.
  \item Predict with a set of linear models of the number of available bikes at
        each of 200 other rental stations.
  \item Predict with any or all of the above.
\end{enumerate}
The predictions are evaluated by the mean absolute error (MAE) between the
predicted and true values of the target variable (the number of available
bikes).
